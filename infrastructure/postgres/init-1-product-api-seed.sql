Isolate is generally cheaper, lower quality and considered less effective than its full spectrum counterpart.\\nFull spectrum oil is rich with cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, fats and lipids. This gives you a much more well-rounded, honest representation of the plant, and harnesses its full potential.\\n“When you’re thinking about isolates vs full spectrum CBD oil, consider sugar,” says Carolina Vasquez Mitchell, Kushy CBD’s Chief Scientist. “On one hand you have the dark brown natural unrefined sugar. The more that you refine the sugar, the clearer and whiter it becomes. But along the way you are losing vital and natural aspects of the sugar. Our oil is the dark brown natural sugar, not the white refined stuff.”"}	{"uom": "MILLIGRAMS", "cbdMg": "450", "doses": "45", "thcMg": "0", "amount": "450", "doseCbdMg": "10", "doseThcMg": "0"}	KushyCBD Tincture	[{"url": "https://store-treez-development.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/productImages/brand/launch/cedd7540-a1bc-4e7d-8a7e-e71c70813055.jpg"}]	KushyCBD Tincture	\N		\N	\N	TINCTURE	\N	CBD	mg	\N	51a79f01-d776-44a4-9e5e-b82ec779ccf3	\N	2019-12-17 13:06:33.456-08	2019-12-17 13:06:33.456-08	'cbd':5,6 'kushycbd':1A,3B 'tinctur':2A,4C	\N	0a639ff8-db2c-469b-a642-6dac91fad3d2	brand
